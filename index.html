            <p>My name is Camden Greenhalgh. I am a fourth year CS student studying at the <a href="https://uidaho.edu">University of Idaho</a>. This is a website about things I like.</p>

                I have done a lot of computer programming. I first learned to code when I was in middle school, via Khan Academy, code.org, and other similar opportunities online. Starting in middle school, I was a
                member of a robotics club, which truly ignited my passion for programming.

                I've always found the deeper ends of computer science, where algorithms are designed out of mathematical logic, to be the most interesting part of computer programming. While programming video games
                can be fun, I've always wanted to know why the computer works at all.

            <p>The things I like most are my pets, Gracie, Gizmo, and Zeus; and my Friends, who I will not share images of for privacy reasons.</p>
